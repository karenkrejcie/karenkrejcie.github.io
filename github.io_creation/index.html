    <h1>Creating a web page on Github</h1>

    <h3>Step 1: Create an Account on Github.com</h3>
    <h5>Already have an account? <a href="#step2">Skip to Step 2</a>.</h5>
    <p>Github is a cloud-based version control system as its core. There's a lot of functionality to Github, but the one
        we will use for this exercise is creating a public-facing website you can call your own!</p>
        <p>To get started, you have to give some details about yourself to Github. Nothing is free, remember. Let's 
            make it happen:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Navigate to the <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github Sign-Up page</a>.</li>
                <li>Enter a valid email address you can access when prompted:<br>
                    <img src="images/signup.png" alt="Enter your Address">
                </li>
                <li>Next, enter a super sleuthy password that meets all the rules of being sleuthy:<br>
                    <img src="images/password.png" alt="Enter a password">
                </li>
                <li>Time to come up with a unique username.  Nice try, but "karenkrejcie" is already taken.<br>
                    <img src="images/username.png" alt="Enter a username">
                </li>
                <li>If you want to read through some product updates and occasional email from Github, now's your chance. Choose wisely.<br>
                    <img src="images/optin.png" alt="Optin to Emails?">
                </li>
                <li>Now it is time to be a human. Do whatever it says to be human.<br>
                    <img src="images/human.png" alt="Prove your human-ness">
                </li>
                <li>Create your account!<br>
                    <img src="images/create.png" alt="Create yaccount">
                </li>
                <li>Login to your email used in #2 above, and retrieve the newly sent Launch Code<br>
                    <img src="images/launch.png" alt="Launch Code">
                </li>
                <li>Set up how your account will primarily be used.<br>
                    <img src="images/team.png" alt="Team Size">
                </li>
                <li>Install features as you see fit.<br>
                    <img src="images/features.png" alt="Lots of features">
                </li>
                <li>Pick a version. Any version.<br>
                    <img src="images/version.png" alt="Free or Apply for Student Version">
                </li>
            </ol>   
            <h3><a name="step2"></a>Step 2: Create a repo(sitory) for your site</h3>
            <p>Github will keep track of various projects you're working on in "repos" or repositories. You can name them 
                anything you want NORMALLY. Since we are trying to make a web page on Github, we have to follow some Github
                protocols to have our free site.  Here we go.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on "Create a Repository" or "Start a Project":<br>
                    <img src="images/start.png" alt="Create a Repository">
                </li>
                <li>Name your Repository, but the name needs to be specific.  Enter: <span style="font-family: courier">username.github.io</span>, 
                    substituting <em>your</em> username for <span style="font-family: courier">username</span><br>
                    <img src="images/name.png" alt="Name your repository">
                </li>
                <li>Create whatever HTML file you want to show up on your website's home page, and name the file <strong>index.html</strong>. <em>Wow, that's bold.  
                    Must be important?  You betcha.</em> HOW do you do THAT, you ask?  That's outside the scope of 
                    this documentation, but here's a snippet of some code you could write in a plain ol' text editor (Windows: Notepad; Mac:
                     <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/textedit/work-with-html-documents-txted0b6cd61/mac" target="_blank">TextEdit with
                    preference changes</a>). Make sure you name it <strong>index.html</strong> and save it somewhere you can find it.<br>
                    <img src="images/snippet.png" alt="Snippet of HTML">
                </li>
                <li>Upload your existing <strong>index.html</strong> by clicking "Uploading an existing file":<br>
                    <img src="images/upload.png" alt="Upload existing file">
                </li>
                <li>Drag your <strong>index.html</strong> into the "Drag files here" area in Github. Don't want to drag? Then browse. That's cool, too. Confirm
                    <strong>index.html</strong> appears. Then, click "Commit changes" to make it official.<br>
                    <img src="images/drag.png" alt="Upload index.html">
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Step 3: Celebrate your new website</h3>
            <p>To see your website in all its glory, check out <span style="font-family: courier">username.github.io</span> substituting <em>your</em> 
                username for <span style="font-family: courier">username</span>.
            </p>
            <p><small>NOTE: It can take upwards of 20 minutes for github to git (see what I did there)</small> your web page published to the Internet.</small></p>
            <p><small>It is advisable to have someone record your "victory dance" when you see your first web page created on github!</small></p>
