                <h3>The Story</h3>
                <p>My purpose in pursuing the certificate in <a href="https://xpro.mit.edu/programs/program-v1:xPRO+PCCx+R1/" target="_blank">Coding through MITxpro</a> is to continue my life's adventure with Coding.
                    I started this journey a <em>few</em> decades ago. It started as an adventure into Accounting, but I 
                    convinced myself I'd get bored of debiting and crediting every day for the rest of the life. Little did I know
                    at that point that Accounting could have been more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I pivoted. I pivot all the time throughout my life's adventure. I took the path down programming at the <a href="https://kelley.iu.edu/" target="_blank">Kelley
                    School of Business at Indiana University</a>. I never looked back. I loved the business sense married with the 
                    technology. And that's where my real professional adventure began. I parlayed my success at Indiana University
                    to the corporate world working in IT at a Fortune 500 corporation for nearly a decade.  Then I got tired of 
                    the corporate IT life and being on call and tending to all needs 24/7.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pivot #2. I was teaching part-time at a local technical/community college throughout my years of corporate IT.
                    I was consistently put in the place of training the new person at work. When I let these two worlds collide,
                    I decided I wanted to commit to teaching at the technical/community college level. I've never had to pivot, career-
                    wise again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More than a decade later (closer to two actually), I'm still committed to providing a quality, technical 
                    2-year education to students of all walks of life. As I tell them in the classroom, "the learning never ends." 
                    That's why I'm here.
                </p>
                <p>Take a gander around at what I've been working on. It's been a minute since I've written JavaScript from scratch,
                    like we have in the first module we have completed to date (April - May 2022). Here's what I have to show
                    for working full-time, mentoring a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU3kLK3lAVxaOwYtGgietaQ/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=0" target="_blank">
                    VEX High School robotics team</a> (who was a 9x world qualifier!) and taking a class 
                    simultaneously.
